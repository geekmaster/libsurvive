An Open-Source tool for working with lighthouse-based trakcing data, including support for the HTC Vive, which is still in the experimental phase.

Most of the development is discussed on Discord.  Join the chat and discussion here: https://discordapp.com/invite/7QbCAGS

## Getting things working

There are two things you should consider doing to your system before running libsurvive.

(1) Install the udev rules:  ```cp usefulfiles/81-vive.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/``` and reboot.
(2) If you are running on an NVIDIA Card, you will need to AllowHMD to true.  Add the following line to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf device section:  ```Option "AllowHMD" "yes"```

## Introduction
High-performance HTC Vive Library

I say "high-performance" really this project is based tightly off of OSVR-Vive-Libre, but, specifically is an attempt to:

1. Minimize external libraries.  Actual reason for starting this: Downloading all of the libraries needed for OSVR-Vive-Libre maxed out my data plan.
2. Put it under an open-source instead of a force-source license.  (GPL to MIT/X11)
3. Write it in C.
4. Avoid extra layers where convenient.
5. (long shot) Make the vive viable for use with Intel Integrated Graphics systems. [It works with HD4000 using DisplayPort. See "Intel Integrated Graphics" section below.]

Will ~~I~~ we succeed?  Probably not.

Definitely going to try!


## External dependencies

* libUSB (hidapi ???)
* pthread
* libX11 (where applicable)
* zlib (may use puff.c if needed)

If I ever get to video output... OpenGL.

## Architecture

There is an internal representation and an external representation.  These lines may get blurred.  Internal representation lives in .h files in the ```src/``` folder. External lives in ```include/``` folder.  

It is written in some fairly stout "layers" which are basically just function calls:

|  Layer | Description | Status |
| ------- | ------------- | -------- |
| survive_usb.c | Data is taken in at "survive_usb.c" from libusb. | Done |
| survive_data.c | Raw HID messages are processed into logical "light" "analog" and "imu" messages. | Mostly done, Missing light data from controllers, and lighthouse data. |
| survive_process.c | Process the high-level data into solutions for | Not yet started.  Will be done by ultramn |

I may or may not read data from the Vive regarding configuration.  If I do, it would be added to the survive_usb.c

## Intel Integrated Graphics

The limiting factor for Vive viability on a given computer is the maximum available pixel clock frequency, and frequency limitations of the HDMI port, and HDMI and DisplayPort video cables. DisplayPort can support higher frequencies than HDMI, on Ivy Bridge HD4000 graphics. In fact, the Vive works with HD4000 graphics using DisplayPort, with native EDID resolution (2160x1200@90Hz).

To support the Vive on HDMI, you either need a newer version of HDMI, or you need to define a custom resolution that respects pixel clock and video port limits, and is also accepted and displayed by the Vive. So far, we have not had success using custom resolutions on linux or on Windows. Windows imposes additional limitations in the form of restriction of WHQL certified drivers forbidden from using custom display resolutions (only allowing those defined by EDID in the monitor). Intel has released uncertified beta drivers for Haswell and newer processors, which should be able to support custom resolutions for the Vive (untested at this time).

It looks like the Vive only supports the few resolutions that are in its EDID. This makes custom resolutions for slower pixel clocks a non-starter -- the custom resolutions available with the new Intel uncertified beta drivers are unlikely to work on older slower HDMI. Only new HDMI (i.e. HDMI 2.0) works so far. Though it really depends on the chipset, available PLL clocks in the video circuitry, and HDMI cable quality.
